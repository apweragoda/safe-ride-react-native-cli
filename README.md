# Safe Ride: Accident Detection and Assistance Mobile App

## Project Overview:

Safe Ride is a robust React Native mobile application designed to enhance road safety by detecting and responding to vehicle accidents promptly. Leveraging mobile sensors and advanced algorithms, the app provides real-time accident detection, automatic distress signal generation, and assistance coordination.

## Key Features:

### 1. **Accident Detection:**
   - Utilizes mobile sensors to detect sudden and unusual movements indicative of a vehicle accident.
   - Implements fuzzy logic to intelligently analyze sensor data for accurate accident identification.

### 2. **Emergency Assistance:**
   - Automatically sends the user's location to relevant authorities, such as nearby hospitals and police stations, in the event of an accident.
   - Integrates with emergency services for quick response and assistance.

### 3. **Notification and Alerts:**
   - Sends automatic email and SMS alerts to pre-configured contacts, including emergency contacts and user-defined contacts.
   - Notifies authorities with comprehensive accident details, aiding in swift response.

### 4. **Search Nearby Locations:**
   - Enables users to search for nearby locations such as hospitals, police stations, and service centers.
   - Integrates map functionalities to display search results and provide detailed information.

### 5. **Direction Assistance:**
   - Offers turn-by-turn navigation and directions to selected destinations.
   - Enhances user safety by providing optimal routes and real-time traffic information.

## Technologies Used:

- **React Native:** Cross-platform mobile app development framework.
- **Mobile Sensors:** Utilizes accelerometer and gyroscope data for accident detection.
- **Fuzzy Logic:** Intelligent data analysis for accurate accident identification.
- **Google Maps API:** Integration for location-based services, search, and directions.
- **Node.js Server:** Backend server for managing emergency notifications and location data.
- **Firebase:** Cloud services for secure storage of user data and notifications.
- **Twilio API:** Integration for sending SMS alerts.
- **Email Service:** Leverages email services for sending automatic email notifications.
